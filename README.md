# GitHubSearch
A JavaScript utility to search for repos by username. Illustrates REST principles using fetch API.

This is based on a JavaScript course called "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning" by Brad Traversy. 
If there's any copyright, it's his: I'm just putting my work up here so I can work on it from wherever. 

I *highly* recommend Brad's courses. Access this one at https://www.udemy.com/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/
